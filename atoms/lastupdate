    Issue 12549 fix atoms generation lowdash (#15247)
    
    * Updating the atom frament bazel file so that "_" is not used as the exported function, also passing in entire window so that all pieces should have access to what they need.
    
    * Added the exported function name to the string substitution list.  Atoms build now.
    
    * Properly adding the exported function variable to the wrapper.
    
    * Updated exported symbol to relate to selenium for namespacing purposes, updating single quotes to to double for linting check.
