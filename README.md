A Node.js frontend for the Remote Debugger protocol used by Appium to connect to iOS webviews and Safari. Written using ES6+.

Issues for this repo are disabled. Log any issues at the [main Appium repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues).

## Safari's version of the WebKit API

Safari implements a wonky version of the WebKit API. It is not documented. But there
is good documentation for the closely related API from Chrome DevTools, to be
[found here](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/);

## API

This is an event emitter, which emits a `RemoteDebugger.EVENT_PAGE_CHANGE` event when there has been a change to the page. This should be caught and handled as the calling code wishes. It also emits a `RemoteDebugger.EVENT_DISCONNECT` event when the server disconnects the last application connected.

The steps to using the `RemoteDebugger` involve instantiating an object, then running `connect` and `selectApp`. After this the instance will be listening for events from the server (i.e., the webview or browser).

## Selenium "atoms"

The remote debugger uses the standard [Selenium Atoms](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/javascript/atoms)
to interact with web pages. These need to manually updated when necessary. To do
so, simply update the branch in `Makefile` by modifying the `SELENIUM_BRANCH`
variable. Then run `npm run build:atoms`, test and create a pull request with
the resulting changed atoms directory.
